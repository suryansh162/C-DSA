// Time Complexity -  it is the amount of time taken by the program to run as a function of length of the input
// why it is needed ? - > for making better program and comparison of algorithms



// big 'O' of n - > shows (upper bound) worst case time complexity
// omega of n -> lower bound
// theta of n -> average case time complexity




// O(1) -> constant time         eg - for loop with fixed count
// O(n) -> linear time           eg - for loop with count "n"
// O(log n) -> lograthmic time   eg - Binary search
// O(n^2) -> Quadratic time      eg - 2 nested loops 
// O(n^3) -> cubic time          eg - 3 nested loops



// complexity less to more
//O(1) ->O(logn) ->O(n)->O(n logn)->O(n^2)->O(n^3)->O(2^n)->O(!N)



// While calculating Time complexity lower degree is ignored

//Space complexity - memory the programme or algorithm will take as a function of length of input 

// constant space - O(1) - 1 --> eg - int a, int b
// n space - O(n) -> eg- arr[n]
