//polymorphism- manyforms(one name multiple forms)
/*//in cpp- 2 types of polimorphism
            a)compile-time polimorphism (also called as early binding or static binding)- in this the object gets bound to the function in the complie time only i.e, which function will run is decided while we are compiling the program  
            achieved by function and operator overloading 
            
            function overloading when we call the function while in the compile time and now its is known to us that which function will run in the compile time only 
            operator overloading when we call the operator while in the compile time and now its is known to us that which operator will run in the compile time only 

            b)run-time polimorphism -achieved by virtual functions - it differs linking of the function call to the run time - that is it postpones the desicion of which function will be called- i.e, we will get to know about which function will run after we compile and run (execute) the program
            we can say that in run time the compiler reads the code but the binding of the functions to the object is only done when program is executed
            and in compile time the binding is done during the compile time 
            
            // in virtual function the binding of the object to the member function of class is done at the run time but that dosent mean that desicion is also taken at run time it could be taken at compile time also
